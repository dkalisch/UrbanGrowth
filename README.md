# UrbanGrowth

After reading the paper from Bettencourt et. al. ([2007][1]), I set out to analyze the correlation between BIP(GDP), BWS(GVA) and population density in German cities.

## Software

The software that is used for this project is R 3.0 with various libraries (see global.dcf file in the config folder)
The Project uses [ProjectTemplate](http://www.projecttemplate.net/). If you have the ProjectTamplate libraries installed, you can just set the woking directory to your GitHub folder (or the folder where you saved the project) with `setwd('/PATH/TO/YOUR/FOLDER')` then just type `load.project()` and all needed libraries are going to be loaded (if they are installed).
